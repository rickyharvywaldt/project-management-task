# project-management-task

For my capstone project I want to build a SaaS for project management similar to Monday.com and TeamGantt. We're already using TeamGantt at my office so I'm familiar with the platform. This is not that. This is my level 1 project, but rather than building a random to-do app, I want to build a functionality that I can use in my capstone project. So for this project I will try and build the add/delete task functionality like in TeamGantt.
